### Hi ! You can call me Umi or Hime ! 

I'm 20 years old, going on 60. I worked as a web developer for a year and studied CS for 3 years. I have an associates degree in Computer Science with a minor in Digital Imaging, as well as a Bachelor's degree in Web Development. 

Right now I'm doing an MRes in UX Design with a minor in Psychology that takes most of my time, but I still like to code for fun from time to time. Things I do for fun are mostly (but not limited to) front-end Web Development.
